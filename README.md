# Smart Rule of Three 📐

A dynamic web-based calculator for simple and compound proportions. This tool features a modern glassmorphism interface that adapts its input fields in real-time based on the number of variables required for the calculation.

## 💡 The Solution
Standard calculators often provide static grids that clutter the UI with unnecessary fields. This project solves that by using:
* **Adaptive Interface**: The JavaScript logic generates specific input columns only after the user defines the number of quantities.
* **Horizontal Flow**: Values are organized side-by-side to visually represent the mathematical relationship ($A \rightarrow B$).
* **Glassmorphism Design**: A premium look achieved with backdrop filters, radial gradients, and Lexend typography.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: Handles real-time DOM manipulation, dynamic field generation, and the calculation of direct/compound proportions.
* **Modern CSS**: Implements Flexbox for absolute centering, glass effects, and `@keyframes` for background animations.
* **HTML5**: A semantic structure designed for dynamic content injection.

## 📂 Project Structure
The code is organized into dedicated files to ensure scalability and clean maintenance:
* `index.html`: Main shell containing the dynamic content containers.
* `style.css`: Visual identity, including glass effects and grid centering.
* `script.js`: State management for steps and the core mathematical logic.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Enter the number of variables (2 for simple, 3+ for compound) and click "Continue".
